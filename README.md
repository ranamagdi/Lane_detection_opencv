# What are the purposes from this project :
1. Your pipeline should be able to detect the lanes, highlight them using a fixed color, and paint the 
area between them in any color you like (we paint to green) <br>
2. Youâ€™re required to be able to roughly estimate the vehicle position away from the center of the 
lane.<br>
3.As a bonus, you can try to estimate the radius of curvature of the road as well (we make it!).


# How to run the code:
## Firstly you need to clone the repo then if you want to see the output from test images :<br>
  You can find Lane_detection_opencv notebook to get the test images with pipeline .
## Secondly if you want to see the output from tet videos :<br>
 1. You can find Lane_detection_opencv.py to get the test videos directly by run the script on the command prompt .<br>
 2. You can also find in the Lane_detection_opencv notebook by run code in 2 last cells .<br>
 ## Note when run the code to get the test video you will show 3 input messages:<br>
 1. Choose the debug mode 1 or 0 (if you will choose 1, your pipeline should be showing all the stages that your code is 
going through.but if you choose 0 you will find the final result from pipeline.<br>
 2. Please write the input video path (you will find in Project_data folder 3 test videos with different levels of curves difficulties.
 3. Please wirte the output video path.
